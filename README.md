## About    

  

Veggie Planet is a project that is intended to be used for the scope of this project, and also outside of this project scope. As a proponent of the vegan lifestyle, I found it quite challenging to source out individual websites that compile a large amount of vegan recipes from various international cuisines. This is why Veggie planet was created. Not only to be a useful resource of vegan recipes, but also promote the vegan food, movement and lifestyle. This site is still work in progress as far as content is concerned, but for the scope of this project, I have opted to primarily design it as a vegan recipe cookbook, by the users, for the users, in which a user can search existing recipes, and also add, edit and delete their own recipes.
